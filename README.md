# Consumer Health Information Search

A large number of websites provide health related information. 
Consumer use of the Internet for seeking health
information is rapidly growing. By 1997, nearly half of
Internet users in the US had sought health information.
Expressed in raw numbers, an estimated 18 million adults in the
US sought health information online in 1998. The majority of
consumers seek for themselves health information related to
diseases for consultation with their physicians. Information
found trough search on the web may influence medical decision
making and help consumers to manage their own care. The
most common topics which are searched on the web are the
leading causes of death (heart disease and cancer) and Children
health. 

Information access mechanisms for factual health information
retrieval have matured considerably, with search engines
providing Fact Checked Health Knowledge Graph search results
to factual health queries. It is pretty straightforward to get an
answer to the query “what are the symptoms of Diabetes” from
these search engines. But the most general purpose
search engines can hardly find the answers of the complex health
search queries which do not have a single definitive answer and
whose answers have multiple perspectives. There may have a
search queries for which there are a large number of search results
reflecting the different perspectives and view-points in favor or
against the query.
The term “Consumer Health Information Search” (CHIS) has
been used by the organizers of the shared task on Consumer
Health Information Search @FIRE 2016 to denote such
information retrieval search tasks for which there are no “Single
Correct Answer(s)” and instead, multiple and diverse
perspectives/points of view, which very often are contradictory in
nature, are available on the web regarding the queried
information1
